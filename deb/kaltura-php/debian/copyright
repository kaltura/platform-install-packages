The file ext/standard/rand.c contains the following clause with a statement
that isn't compatible with the DFSG:
  "The code as Shawn received it included the following notice:

     Copyright (C) 1997 Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.  When
     you use this, send an e-mail to <matumoto@math.keio.ac.jp> with
     an appropriate reference to your work."
However, this requirement has been rescinded by the copyright holder in
message <48E334A2.6050301@math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp> to bug #498621.
