php5 (5.4.45-0+deb7u2) wheezy-security; urgency=medium

  * PHP 5.4 has reached end-of-life on 14 Sep 2015 and as a result there
    will be no more new upstream releases.  The security support of PHP
    5.4 in Debian will be best effort only and you are strongly advised
    to upgrade to latest stable Debian release that includes PHP 5.6 that
    will reach end of security support on 28 Aug 2017.

php5 (5.4.4-14+deb7u9) stable; urgency=medium

  * The default PHP FPM socket permission has been changed from 0666
    to 0660 to mitigate security vulnerability (CVE-2014-0185) in PHP
    FPM that allowed any local user to run a PHP code under the active
    user of FPM process via crafted FastCGI client.

    The default Debian setup now correctly sets the listen.owner and
    listen.group to www-data:www-data in default www pool configuration
    (/opt/kaltura/app/configurations/php/fpm/pool.d/www.conf).  If you have more FPM instances or
    a webserver not running under www-data user you need to adjust the
    configuration of FPM pools in /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/php/fpm/pool.d/ so the accessing
    process has rights to access the socket.

php5 (5.4.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * As a side effect of the MIME-Type changes in the mime-support package,
    the default Apache 2 configuration will no longer perform HTTP content
    negotiation on the PHP file extensions, which was very questionable
    anyway.  If you really want to re-enable this support then please read
    /usr/share/doc/php5-common/README.Debian file for further
    instructions.

php5 (5.4.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * As a security measure the default configuration for Apache 2 has been
    changed to a stricter model.  Only files which have the correct
    rightmost extension, and at least one character in the filename before
    that extension, are now interpreted by PHP.  For a full list of
    handled extensions please see the Apache 2 configuration.  At the time
    of writing this paragraph, the list includes the following regular
    expressions:
  
      1. .+\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml)$ for PHP files (application/x-httpd-php)
      2. .+\.phps$ for PHP source files (application/x-httpd-php-source)

    Previously, as a side effect of system MIME type definitions, the
    default configuration would allow the interpreting of files with a
    double extension, where the second extension was either unrecognised
    or a language or content encoding to be interpreted; e.g. an uploaded
    file named blackhat.php.foobar or index.php.cs would be interpreted by
    PHP.  These non-standard definitions have been removed from the
    mime-support packages and all configuration of PHP handlers is now
    defined in the Apache 2 configuration files.
  
    The standard configuration now also denies access to files with names
    which consist of an extension and nothing more; e.g. accessing '/.php'
    will now return Access Denied instead of the output of the PHP script.
  
    You can use the following command to find whether there are any files
    on your system which would be affected by this change (change <base>
    to the directory name where you store PHP files on your system):

    # find <base> -name '*.ph[pt].*' -o -name '*.php[345s].*' -o \
                  -name '*.phtml.*' -o -name '.ph[pt]' -o \
                  -name '.php[345s]' -o -name '.phtml'

php5 (5.4.0~rc8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  php5-fpm default www spool now listens on unix socket located
  in /var/run/php5-fpm.sock instead of localhost:9000.  If you
  have configured your webserver to use localhost:9000, you will
  have to change your settings.

php5 (5.4.0~rc6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  t1lib support was removed from PHP 5.4.  t1lib has many security
  issues and is unmaintained by upstream for a very long time (3 years).

  For more information see:
    + http://bugs.debian.org/637488
    + http://bugs.debian.org/638755
  
  This unfortunately also means that following functions are not
  available in PHP5 from now:
  
    - imagepsloadfont
    - imagepsfreefont
    - imagepsencodefont
    - imagepsextendfont
    - imagepsslantfont
    - imagepstext
    - imagepsbbox

  If you really need those functions you will need to install t1lib from
  sources.  You will need to install php5-dev and recompile GD extension
  (roughly) using following commands:

    cd <path_to_php5_sources>/ext/gd/
    phpize
    configure --with-gd=shared,/usr --enable-gd-native-ttf \
      --with-t1lib=<location_of_your_t1lib>
    make
    make install

php5 (5.3.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Suhosin patch is now disabled in the default build.

  If you want to re-enable it again for your installation, you can
  set the option PHP5_SUHOSIN=yes in debian/rules and recompile PHP.

php5 (5.3.6-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated blowfish crypt() algorithm fixes the 8-bit character handling
    vulnerability (CVE-2011-2483) and adds more self-tests.  Unfortunately
    this change is incompatible with some old (wrong) generated hashes for
    passwords containing 8-bit characters.

    It is recommended that any passwords containing characters with
    the 8th bit set be changed after this upgrade. In order to allow users
    to log in after the upgrade even if they have a potentially affected
    password, the newly introduced backwards compatibility hash encoding
    prefix of "$2x$" may be used (in place of the usual "$2a$"). Such
    password hashes should only be used during a transition period; when
    passwords are changed, the usual "$2a$" prefix is used, denoting the
    correct algorithm.

php5 (5.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * mod_php disabled in userdirs.

  The default Debian libapache2-mod-php5 package now disables the PHP
  engine on ~/public_html directories when mod_userdir is enabled, for
  security reasons.  Although discouraged, it can be re-enabled by
  commenting the <IfModule mod_userdir.c> block in
  /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf

  * PHP 5.2 compatibility settings

  Given the short time to the Squeeze release freeze, the
  short_open_tag setting has been turned On again (upstream now
  defaults to Off on the php.ini files.) However, the request_order and
  auto_globals_jit settings continue to be the default from upstream
  ("GP" and On, respectively.)

php5 (5.2.11.dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Maximum number of file uploads per request limited

  To prevent Denial of Service attacks by exhausting the number of
  available temporary file names, upstream introduced the max_file_uploads
  option in 5.3.1 and 5.2.12.

  Due to the nature of this new option a default limit has been set
  to 50, hoping it is sensible enough to not to cause disruptions on
  existing services.
  The value of this new limit can be changed in the php.ini file.

  If you installed the php5-suhosin extension there was a limiting
  mechanism in place already. In this case you may want to make sure
  the new limit imposed by PHP itself is not smaller than suhosin's.

php5 (5.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now uses system timezone database.

  Debian PHP now makes use of the system wide timezone database from the
  tzdata package, making sure any updates there are automatically used
  by PHP aswell. Note that this requires that the PHP process has access
  to /etc/localtime and /usr/share/zoneinfo (this is usually the case).

  * New php5-dbg package.

  We are now shipping a php5-dgb package which will greatly aid in finding
  the cause of many crashes that you may experience.  So if you are going to
  report a bug for a reproducible crash, please install this package before
  sending a backtrace.

  * New libapache2-mod-php5filter package.

  We are now also shipping a new libapache2-mod-php5filter package which
  uses the "Apache 2.0 filter-module support via DSO through APXS".

php5 (5.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The Suhosin patch is now enabled by default!

  For more information, see
  <http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/index.html>.

  Special thanks to Blars Blarson for providing a sparc machine for testing
  that the patch seems to work okay on that architecture.  If you experience
  otherwise let us know!

  Suggestions are welcome for default configuration options, examples,
  documentation, etc.

  In any event please report successes and/or failures to us at
  pkg-php-maint@lists.alioth.debian.org.
